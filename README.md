# Arduino Uno Air Conditioner Project
Project is being part of a university course on Real-Time Computing.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a simulation of an air conditioner built on the Arduino Uno platform using the Wokwi simulator. The project showcases the basic functions of an air conditioner, such as temperature and humidity measurement, operating modes (e.g., cooling, heating, ventilation, humidification, dehumidification), and remote control via an IR remote.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Uno**: The central control unit.
- **LCD I2C Display**: Displays information about the operating mode, temperature, and humidity.
- **DHT22 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **IR Remote**: Remote control for operating the air conditioner.
- **IR Receiver**: Infrared receiver to receive signals from the remote.
